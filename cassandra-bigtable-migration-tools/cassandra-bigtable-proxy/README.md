## When to use Cassandra to Bigtable Proxy?

`cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` enables applications that are currently using
Apache Cassandra or DataStax Enterprise (DSE) and would like to switch to use
Cloud Bigtable. This Proxy Adapter can be used as Plug-N-Play for the Client
Application without the need of any code changes in the Client Application.

## Pre-requisites

- Go v1.24
- Cloud Bigtable Database Instance
- Docker(Optional)
- GCP Service Account with Read/Write Permissions to Cloud Bigtable

Additionally,

You will need a [Google Cloud Platform Console][developer-console] project with
the Cloud Bigtable [API enabled][enable-api].
You will need to [enable billing][enable-billing] to use Google Cloud Bigtable.
[Follow these instructions][create-project] to get your project set up.

## Authenticate and Authorize with Google Cloud

To run the **Cassandra-to-Bigtable Proxy**, you must be **authenticated and
authorized** to make API calls to Google Cloud Bigtable.
There are **two primary ways** to authenticate, each suited for different
environments:

1. **Using `gcloud auth login` and a Service Account Key** *(Recommended for
   servers/production)*
2. **Using `gcloud auth application-default login`** *(Recommended for local
   development)*

---

### Option 1: Authenticate Using `gcloud auth login` and a Service Account Key

**Use this method when running the proxy on a VM, server, or in a production
environment.**

This method involves downloading a Service Account JSON key file and setting
the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to its
location.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a Service Account:**
    * In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.
    * Create a new service account with the necessary Cloud Bigtable Read/Write
      permissions.
2. **Download the Service Account Key:**
    * After creating the service account, generate a JSON key file and download
      it to your local machine or server.
3. **Authenticate with `gcloud auth login`:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```
4. **Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:**
    * Replace `/path/to/your/service-account.json` with the actual path to your
      downloaded JSON key file.
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account.json"
   ```
    * **Important:** For persistent environment variable settings, add this line
      to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).
5. **Set the `GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable:**
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
   ```

---

### Option 2: Authenticate Using `gcloud auth application-default login`

**Use this method for local development and testing.**

This method uses your Google Cloud user account credentials, which are typically
obtained via the `gcloud` CLI.

**Steps:**

1. **Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
    * This command will open a browser window, prompting you to log in to your
      Google Cloud account.
    * After successful login, your credentials will be stored in the Application
      Default Credentials (ADC) location.
2. **Set the `GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable:**
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
   ```
    * **Note:** When using this method, you **do not** need to set
      the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. The ADC
      automatically handles authentication.

## Setting Up Bigtable Instance and Schema Configuration

Before starting the `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` Adapter, it's essential to set
up the necessary infrastructure within Cloud Bigtable. This involves creating a
Bigtable instance and configuring the schema using DDL commands.

The `schema_mapping` table acts as a metadata repository, holding the schema
configuration for your Cassandra-like tables in Bigtable. It stores details such
as column names, data types, and primary key information.

**Setup Process:**

There are two primary methods for setting up your Bigtable infrastructure:

### DDL Support for Schema Creation

The proxy now supports Data Definition Language (DDL) operations, making it
easier to create and manage tables directly through CQL commands. This is the
recommended approach for setting up your schema.

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Create Bigtable Instance:**
    - Create a Bigtable instance manually through the Google Cloud Console or
      using `gcloud` commands.
    - [Creating a Cloud Bigtable instance](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/creating-instance)
    - Make sure to create an app profile in the Bigtable instance if needed.

2. **Configure Proxy:**
    - Update `config.yaml` with your Bigtable instance details and other
      configuration parameters.
    - The proxy will automatically create the `schema_mapping` table if it
      doesn't exist.

3. **Start the Proxy:**
   ```bash
   ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy -f config.yaml
   ```
    - The proxy will start with an empty cache since no tables exist yet.

4. **Create Tables Using CQLSH:**
    - Connect to the proxy using CQLSH:
      ```bash
      cqlsh localhost 9042
      ```
    - Create tables using standard Cassandra CQL syntax:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE keyspace.table (
          id bigint,
          name text,
          age int,
          PRIMARY KEY ((id), name)
      );
      ```
    - The proxy will automatically:
        - Create the table in Bigtable
        - Set up necessary column families
        - Populate the schema_mapping table with the configuration

5. **Batch Table Creation:**
    - You can create multiple tables at once using a SQL file:
      ```bash
      cqlsh localhost 9042 -f schema.sql
      ```
    - The `schema.sql` file can contain multiple CREATE TABLE statements.

6. **Table Modifications:**
    - The proxy supports ALTER TABLE and DROP TABLE operations:
      ```sql
      -- Add a new column
      ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ADD email text;
      
      -- Drop a table
      DROP TABLE keyspace.table;
      ```

## Proxy Configuration YAML Configuration Explained

The `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` Adapter is configured using the `config.yaml`
file located in the root directory of the application. This file allows you to
specify various settings, including listener configurations, Bigtable connection
details, open telemetry configurations and logging options.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the configuration variables:

```yaml
cassandraToBigtableConfigs:
  # [Optional] Global default GCP Project ID
  projectId: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT
  # [Optional] Global default configuration table name
  schemaMappingTable: SCHEMA_MAPPING_TABLE_NAME
  #[Required] Default column family for primitive data types
  defaultColumnFamily: DEFAULT_COLUMN_FAMILY

listeners:
- name: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
  port: PORT_NUMBER
  bigtable:
    # [Optional], skip if it is the same as global_projectId.
    projectId: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT
    #[Optional] appProfileID(Gobal)is required only if you want to use a specific app profile.
    appProfileID: YOUR_BIGTABLE_PROFILE_ID
    # If you want to use multiple instances then pass the instance names by comma seperated
    # Instance(cassandra keyspace) name should not contain any special characters except underscore(_)
    # if instanceIds values given here then proxy wont read from the below instances list
    # Note: only either instancesIds or instances can be defined. Defining both is not allowed.
    instanceIds: YOUR_BIGTABLE_INSTANCE 1,YOUR_BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_2
    
    # If you want to use multiple instances, define them as a list of objects below.
    instances:
    - # [Required] The name of the Bigtable instance.
      bigtableInstance: YOUR_BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_ID
      # [Required] The cassandra keyspace associated with this Bigtable instance.
      # Cassandra keyspace should not contain any special characters except underscore(_).
      keyspace: YOUR_KEYSPACE_NAME
      # [Optional] appProfileID is required only if you want to use a specific app profile for this instance.
      # This will override the global appProfileID if specified.
      appProfileID: YOUR_APP_PROFILE_ID

    # [Required] Name of the table  where cassandra schema to bigtable schema mapping is stored.
    schemaMappingTable: SCHEMA_MAPPING_TABLE_NAME

    # [Optional] Default column family for primitive data types is "cf1".
    defaultColumnFamily: DEFAULT_COLUMN_FAMILY

    # [Optional] Whether to automatically refresh metadata from Bigtable. The default is true. 
    enableMetadataRefresh: true
      
    # Number of grpc channels to be used for Bigtable session.
    Session:
      grpcChannels: 4

otel:
  # Set enabled to true or false for OTEL metrics/traces/logs.
  enabled: False

  # Set enabled to true or false for client side OTEL (metrics/traces).
  enabledClientSideMetrics: True

  # Name of the collector service to be setup as a sidecar
  serviceName: YOUR_OTEL_COLLECTOR_SERVICE_NAME

  healthcheck:
    # Enable the health check in this proxy application config only if the
    # "health_check" extension is added to the OTEL collector service configuration.
    #
    # Recommendation:
    # Enable the OTEL health check if you need to verify the collector's availability
    # at the start of the application. For development or testing environments, it can
    # be safely disabled to reduce complexity.

    # Enable/Disable Health Check for OTEL, Default 'False'.
    enabled: False
    # Health check endpoint for the OTEL collector service
    endpoint: OTEL_HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINT
  metrics:
    # Collector service endpoint
    endpoint: YOUR_OTEL_COLLECTOR_SERVICE_ENDPOINT

  traces:
    # Collector service endpoint
    endpoint: YOUR_OTEL_COLLECTOR_SERVICE_ENDPOINT
    # Sampling ratio should be between 0 and 1. Here 0.05 means 5/100 Sampling ratio.
    samplingRatio: 1

loggerConfig:
  # Specifies the type of output, here it is set to 'file' indicating logs will be written to a file.
  # Value of `outputType` should be `file` for file type or `stdout` for standard output.
  # Default value is `stdout`.
  outputType: stdout
  # Set this only if the outputType is set to `file`.
  # The path and name of the log file where logs will be stored. For example, output.log, Required Key.
  # Default `/var/log/cassandra-to-spanner-proxy/output.log`.
  fileName: output/output.log
  # Set this only if the outputType is set to `file`.
  # The maximum size of the log file in megabytes before it is rotated. For example, 500 for 500 MB.
  maxSize: 10
  # Set this only if the outputType is set to `file`.
  # The maximum number of backup log files to keep. Once this limit is reached, the oldest log file will be deleted.
  maxBackups: 2
  # Set this only if the outputType is set to `file`.
  # The maximum age in days for a log file to be retained. Logs older than this will be deleted. Required Key.
  # Default 3 days
  maxAge: 1

  # Set this only if the outputType is set to `file`.
  # Default value is set to 'False'. Change the value to 'True', if log files are required to be compressed.
  compress: True
  ```

**Important Note:**

* These configurations are essential and must be configured correctly before
  starting the proxy Adapter. Incorrect configurations can lead to connection
  failures or unexpected behavior.
* Ensure that you replace the placeholder values (e.g., YOUR_GCP_PROJECT,
  PORT_NUMBER) with your actual configuration settings.
* The defaultColumnFamily must be specified.
* If you have created application profile then you can specify otherwise comment
  out it in `config.yaml` so that it will pick `default` column family
  automatically
* When using multiple Bigtable instances, ensure that the schema mapping table
  is available in all the Bigtable instances.
* When using OTEL, ensure that the OTEL collector service is configured
  correctly.
* If you modify any value in the config.yaml file, you must restart the proxy
  Adapter for the changes to take effect.

## Getting started

We can set up the `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` Adapter via 3 different methods
as mentioned below

- Download and run `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy`
- Locally build and run `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy`
- Run a docker image that has `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` installed
- Use a Kubernetes container to run `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy`

### Download and Run Proxy Locally
For the easiest and recommended setup, you can download the prebuilt binaries directly from GitHub. This allows you to skip the manual build process entirely.

Go to the Cloud Bigtable Ecosystem Releases page.

Download the binary that matches your operating system and architecture. They follow the naming convention cassandra-proxy-<os>-<arch>. For example:

* cassandra-proxy-darwin-amd64 (Mac Intel)
* cassandra-proxy-darwin-arm64 (Mac Apple Silicon)
* cassandra-proxy-linux-amd64 (Linux x86_64)
* cassandra-proxy-linux-arm64 (Linux ARM64)

Once downloaded, grant execute permissions to the binary. For example:
```shell
chmod +x cassandra-proxy-darwin-amd64
```
Run the proxy with your configuration file:

```shell
./cassandra-proxy-darwin-amd64 -f config.yaml
```

### Build and Run Proxy Locally

Steps to run the Adapter locally are as mentioned below:

- Clone the
  repository (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-ecosystem.git)
- Update `config.yaml`
  #### There are several ways to run/start proxy(Using Build and without Build):
  **1. Using Build**
    ```ssh
    go build -o cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy .
    // Compiles for your current OS & architecture (e.g., Mac M1 = darwin/arm64)

    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy .
    // Cross-compiles for Linux (x86_64) (for running on a Linux server or VM)
    
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy .
    // Cross-compiles for Mac M1/M2 (ARM64)
    
    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy .
    // Builds a static binary for Linux x86_64 (portable, no external C dependencies) 
    ```

  *Once you create the build then execute the below command to run the
  application*
  ```sh
  ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy -f config.yaml
  ```

  **2. Without Build**
    - You can start proxy directly without creating build, execute the below
      command to start the proxy.
  ```sh
  go run proxy.go -f config.yaml
  ```

- Optional Arguments with the default values.
    - **cql-version**: CQL version, **default value: "3.4.5"**
    - **partitioner**: Partitioner, **default value: "
      org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner"**
    - **release-version**: Release Version, **default value: "4.0.0.6816"**
    - **data-center**: Data center, **default value: "datacenter1"**
    - **protocol-version**: Initial protocol version to use when connecting to
      the backend cluster, **default value: v4**
    - **log-level**: , set log level - [info/debug/error/warn] **default value:
      info**
    - **tcp-bind-port** or **-t**: TCP port to bind to, **default value: 9042**
    - **rpc-address**: RPC address to bind to(This is specifically useful when
      connecting to zdm-proxy), **default value: 0.0.0.0**
    - **use-unix-socket** or **-u**: Enable Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connection.
      See [UDS Connection](#unix-domain-socket--uds--connection) for details.
    - **unix-socket-path**: Path for the Unix Domain Socket file, **default
      value: "/tmp/cassandra-proxy.sock"**

- Run the Application with the arguments example
  ```sh
  ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --log-level error -t 9043 -f config.yaml
  ```

- Application will be listening on the specified TCP port (default: 9042).

#### Quick Start

This is the fastest and simplest way to get started with the Proxy, once you've
built the proxy and created your Bigtable instance. With this setup, you don't
need
to use a config.yaml file. More complicated setups, like supporting multiple
keyspaces, can be achieved with a config.yaml file. You may use quick start
setups alongside a config file, but we recommend keeping all of your config in
one place.

```
./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --project-id='YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID' --instance-id='YOUR_BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_ID' --keyspace-id='YOUR_CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE'
```

- **project-id** the Google Cloud project id to use
- **instance-id** the Bigtable instance id to use
- **keyspace-id** (Optional) the Cassandra keyspace that will be mapped to the
  Bigtable instance. If undefined, the instance-id will double as the keyspace.
- **port** (Optional) the port for the Proxy to listen on. The default
  is `9042`.
- **app-profile** (Optional, but recommended) the Bigtable app profile that will
  be used to connect to Bigtable.
- **default-column-family** (Optional) the Bigtable column family that all
  scalar values will be written to. The default is `cf1`.
- **schema-mapping-table** (Optional) the name of the Bigtable table that will
  be used to store schema information. The default is `schema_mapping`. The
  table will be automatically created.

### Run Proxy via Docker

- Build docker image
  ```sh
    docker build --no-cache -t cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy:local .
  ```

- Start docker container using generated image

  ```sh
    docker run -d --name cassandra-bigtable-proxy \
    -p 9042:9042 \
    -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/var/run/secret/cloud.google.com/bigtable-Adapter-service-account.json" \
    -v <<path to service account>>/bigtable-Adapter-service-account.json:/var/run/secret/cloud.google.com/ \
    cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy:local
  ```

## CQLSH support with Proxy

- You can use the cqlsh command line tool with the cassandra-bigtable-proxy.
  Detailed
  document - [cqlsh.md](./docs/cqlsh.md)

## Limitations for Proxy Application

Detailed document - [Limitations](./docs/limitations.md)

## Guidelines for Proxy Application

- The Proxy Adapter supports DML operations such as INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and
  SELECT.
- To run the Raw DML queries, it is mandatory for all values except numerics to
  have single quotes added to it. For eg.

  ```sh
  SELECT * FROM keyspace.table WHERE name='john doe';

  INSERT INTO keyspace.table (id, name) VALUES (1, 'john doe');
  ```

- Before running the proxy application, stop the Cassandra service as both run
  on the same port 9042.

- All the required tables should be created on Cloud Bigtable and its schema
  should be updated in schema_mapping table before running the Proxy Adapter.

- Bigtable does not allow conditional WRITES operations. Currently, for UPDATE
  and DELETE operations, we accept columns that are part of the primary key and
  help us construct the rowkey that is required for these operations.

- For select operation, we can apply the conditions on the columns which are the
  type of string and INT64, the support for other datatypes has not been added
  to bigtable yet.

  ```python
  import time
  from cassandra import ConsistencyLevel
  from cassandra.cluster import Cluster, BatchStatement

  cluster = Cluster(['<<IP address>>'], port=<port>, protocol_version=4, connect_timeout=10)
  session = cluster.connect(keyspace='<<keyspace_name>>', wait_for_all_pools=True)
  session.default_consistency_level=ConsistencyLevel.LOCAL_QUORUM

  # Insert block
  pr = session.prepare("insert into keyspace.table ( guid, name, age, gender ) VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?);")
  rs = session.execute(pr, ("XXYYZZAAA",time.time(), 12, "male" ))
  print("Insert Successful")

  # Select block
  pr = session.prepare("select * from keyspace.table where guid = ?;")
  rs = session.execute(pr, ("XXYYZZAA",))
  print("selected rows - ", rs.all())

   # Update block
  pr = session.prepare("update keyspace.table set age=? where guid=?;")
  rs = session.execute(pr, (15, "XXYYZZAA",))
  print("Update Successful")

  # Delete block
  pr = session.prepare("delete from keyspace.table where guid = ?;")
  rs = session.execute(pr, ("XXYYZZAA",))
  print("Delete Successful")
  ```

| map<key, value>  | ✓         | Col name as col family, MAP key as column qualifier, value as value                |
| set&lt;item&gt;  | ✓         | Col name as col family, SET item as column qualifier, value remain empty           |
| list&lt;item&gt; | ✓         | Col name as col family, current timestamp as column qualifier, list items as value |

All list types follow the same storage pattern:  
**Col name as col family, current timestamp (with nanosecond precision) as
column qualifier, list items as column value.**

- Before running the proxy application, make sure to stop the Cassandra service
  as both runs on the same port 9042.

## Run a `cassandra-to-bigtable-proxy` via systemd.

Why systemd? - It can automatically restart crashed services, which is crucial
for maintaining the availability of applications and system functions. systemd
also provides mechanisms for service sandboxing and security.

Go through this document for setting up systemd for this project in your linux
system - [Setting Up systemd](./systemd/Readme.md)

## Instrument with OpenTelemetry

The Proxy Adapter supports OpenTelemetry metrics and traces, which gives insight
into the adapter internals and aids in debugging/troubleshooting production
issues.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some tips for debugging common proxy issues.

### Confirm you're connected to the cassandra-bigtable-proxy

You can confirm that you're connected to the cassandra-bigtable-proxy by
running:

```shell
cqlsh -e 'SELECT cluster_name FROM system.local'
```

If you're connected to the proxy, you should see something
like `cassandra-bigtable-proxy-v0.2.1` for the cluster name. The proxy uses "
cassandra-bigtable-proxy-<version>" as it's host name (old versions are just "
cql-proxy"), where <version> is the released version of the proxy.

### NotFound error code

If you see a Bigtable rpc NotFound error, most likely during start up, this is
because some Bigtable resource was not found. Most likely causes are forgetting
to create the Bigtable instance that your Cassandra keyspace will map to, or
mixing up your keyspace with your instance id. Check your proxy configuration
and try again.

### ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT error

If you see an ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT error, your Bigtable Proxy server
doesn't have the necessary scope to connect to Bigtable (this is separate from
IAM). Stop the server, set "Cloud API access scopes" to "Allow full access
to all Cloud APIs" and restart the server.

## Testing

The project includes several types of tests to ensure code quality and
functionality. Each test type has its own specific purpose and execution method.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components of the codebase in isolation.

```sh
go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /testing/)
```

### Compliance Tests

Compliance tests ensure that the proxy behaves correctly according to expected
standards and specifications. These tests also serve as integration tests.

For detailed instructions on running compliance tests, refer to
the [Compliance Test Cases](./testing/compliance/README.md)
documentation.

### Fuzzing Tests

Fuzzing tests use automated techniques to find edge cases and potential issues
in the codebase.

For detailed instructions on running fuzzing tests, refer to
the [Fuzzing Tests](./testing/fuzzing/README.md) documentation.

## Connection Methods

The proxy supports three different connection methods to accommodate various
deployment scenarios and security requirements.

### Plain TCP Connection

The simplest way to connect to the proxy is using plain TCP. This is suitable
for local development or secure internal networks.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Start the proxy with default TCP settings:
   ```bash
   ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy -f config.yaml
   ```
   This will listen on `0.0.0.0:9042` by default.

2. Connect using a Cassandra client:
   ```java
   Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
       .addContactPoint("localhost")
       .withPort(9042)
       .build();
   Session session = cluster.connect();
   ```

### Secured TCP Connection (TLS)

For production environments or when security is a concern, you can enable TLS
encryption.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. If you don't have TLS certificates, generate them:
    - key.pem and cert.pem

Example:

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
   ```

- Note: Check official documentation for generating certificates

2. Start the proxy with TLS enabled:
   ```bash
   ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --proxy-cert-file cert.pem --proxy-key-file key.pem -f config.yaml
   ```

3. Connect using a Cassandra client with TLS:
   ```java
   Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
       .addContactPoint("localhost")
       .withPort(9042)
       .withSSL(new SSLOptions())
       .build();
   Session session = cluster.connect();
   ```

### Unix Domain Socket (UDS) Connection

UDS provides better performance and security for local connections. This is
ideal for applications running on the same machine as the proxy.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Install socat (required for bridging TCP to UDS):
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install socat
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install socat
   ```

2. Start the proxy with UDS enabled:
   ```bash
   ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --use-unix-socket -f config.yaml
   ```
   This will create a Unix socket at `/tmp/cassandra-proxy.sock` by default.

   You can specify a custom path:
   ```bash
   ./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --use-unix-socket --unix-socket-path "/path/to/custom.sock" -f config.yaml
   ```

3. Set up socat to bridge TCP to UDS:
   ```bash
   socat TCP-LISTEN:9042,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/cassandra-proxy.sock
   ```

4. Connect using a Cassandra client (it will connect via TCP, which socat
   bridges to UDS):
   ```java
   Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
       .addContactPoint("localhost")
       .withPort(9042)
       .build();
   Session session = cluster.connect();
   ```

**Note:** The socat bridge is necessary because the standard Cassandra Java
driver doesn't support UDS directly. The bridge allows you to use UDS for better
performance while maintaining compatibility with existing clients.

## Supported Cassandra Versions

The Cassandra to Bigtable Proxy has been tested and verified to work with the
following Cassandra versions:

- **Cassandra 4.x**: Fully tested and supported
- **Cassandra 3.x**: Should be compatible but not extensively tested

The proxy is configured to use Cassandra 4.0 protocol by default, but it should
be able to handle connections from Cassandra 3.x clients. If you're using
Cassandra 3.x, please test thoroughly in your environment and report any issues.

To specify a different protocol version when starting the proxy, use
the `--protocol-version` flag:

```bash
./cassandra-bigtable-proxy --protocol-version v3 -f config.yaml
```

Note that some features may behave differently between Cassandra 3.x and 4.x.
